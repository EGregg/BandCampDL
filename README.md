# BandCampDL

Useful tool for downloading and organizing music purchased from BandCamp.com

Common issue:
  lxml not being able to be installed by $pip install lxml, 
    easiest solution is to go here:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml
    download the lxml file that matches your python distribution and place it in the LIB folder of your python installation
    navigate to the LIB folder in the cmd prompt then do a manual installation by $python -m pip install <complete name of lxml file including .whl extension>
